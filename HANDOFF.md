When Taylor is ready to relaunch the portfolio, replace the temporary construction page in `index.html` with the approved redesign, then validate and deploy it. The temporary page intentionally retains email, LinkedIn, and résumé access for recruiters.

- **Changed:** Replaced the public homepage with a focused, accessible under-construction page while the portfolio is rebuilt. Kept verified email, LinkedIn, and current résumé download links available.
- **Commit:** `ad4be6e` (`feat: add temporary construction page`)
- **Tests:** `npx --yes html-validate index.html` (pass); verified `resume/TaylorRitchie_Resume.pdf` exists; `git diff --check` (pass).
- **Next:** Relaunch the full portfolio only after Taylor approves its redesign.

### 2026-07-20 · Codex
- **Changed:** Taylor explicitly approved merging PR #1. Updated the return point from pre-merge review to post-merge GitHub Pages verification.
- **Commit:** `docs: set post-merge deployment return point`
- **Tests:** No source changes; the production implementation remains covered by the validation recorded below.
- **Unresolved:** GitHub Pages deployment must finish before the live URL can be verified.
- **Next:** Merge PR #1, then verify the homepage, résumé, and SystemHorizon production routes.

### 2026-07-20 · Codex
- **Changed:** Promoted the approved editorial prototype into `index.html`; removed the superseded root-level concept copy; added production navigation, SEO/Open Graph metadata, `ProfilePage` structured data, keyboard focus treatment, reduced-motion behavior, and mobile navigation; rewrote featured work as evidence-led cases; added a native-details secondary archive using representative existing assets; preserved the `systemhorizon/`, tracker, portfolio document, and image routes; and added the current Business Systems & CRM Operations résumé at the canonical public path `resume/TaylorRitchie_Resume.pdf`.
- **Content:** Used `706-767-7196` from `TaylorRitchie_MasterResume_Source_20260720.docx`; retained the four approved homepage metrics; did not elevate the disputed Stripe metrics; used the current official title and privacy language; and linked the verified canonical LinkedIn profile URL.
- **Commit:** `585aa89` (`feat: promote editorial redesign to production homepage`)
- **Tests:** `npx --yes html-validate index.html` (pass); `node tests/site-audit.mjs http://127.0.0.1:4173/` (pass at 320, 375, 480, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, and 1920 px; local links, duplicate IDs, one `h1`, alt text, disputed-metric absence, navigation, archive control, anchor behavior, horizontal scrolling, and browser console errors); `git diff --check` (pass); visual inspection of the current two-page résumé render and 320/1440 homepage screenshots (pass).
- **Unresolved:** Human review is still required for final visual preference and authorization to merge. No production deployment or merge was performed.
- **Next:** Review PR #1, confirm final visuals, and merge to `main` when approved.

### 2026-07-20 · ChatGPT
- **Changed:** Created `feat/romeo-juliet-resume-redesign` and added a complete responsive single-page concept in `romeo-juliet-concept.html`. The concept includes the cinematic name-card hero, broadcast-style About section, impact metric strip, chapter-card experience, editorial portfolio grid, theatrical playbill capabilities section, and `FIN.` contact close. Content is grounded in the current resume and professional portfolio while avoiding the disputed Stripe migration metric.
- **Commit:** `b35e590`
- **Next:** Review the concept, revise the art direction/content, then promote the approved design into `index.html` and reconnect the complete portfolio assets.

- **Commit:** `2bc88ba`
- **Next:** Repoint the systemhorizon-build skill; archive the old SystemHorizon repo.
